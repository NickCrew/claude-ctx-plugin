# Credits & Attribution

This project builds upon ideas, patterns, and content from several excellent open-source projects in the Claude Code ecosystem.

## Adapted Content & Derived Works

### Superpowers
**Repository:** [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers)
**License:** MIT License
**Attribution:** Significant portions of claude-ctx's skills, logic patterns, and intelligent activation system were directly copied and adapted from obra/superpowers.

**Skills Adapted (from 54 total skills):**
At least 10+ skills in the `skills/` directory are derived from Superpowers, including:
- `systematic-debugging` - Root cause analysis framework
- `test-driven-development` - TDD workflow patterns
- `verification-before-completion` - Quality gate enforcement
- `requesting-code-review` - Code review request patterns
- `receiving-code-review` - Code review response handling
- `subagent-driven-development` - Multi-agent development workflows
- `using-git-worktrees` - Git worktree management
- `testing-skills-with-subagents` - Skill testing methodology
- `sharing-skills` - Skill contribution workflows
- `writing-skills` - Skill creation patterns
- `collaboration/brainstorming` - Collaborative discovery workflows
- `collaboration/executing-plans` - Plan execution discipline
- Additional workflow and quality-focused skills

**Logic & Concepts Adapted:**
- Intelligent skill activation based on context detection
- Auto-activation triggers and pattern matching
- Skill dependency management and orchestration
- Systematic problem-solving workflows
- Quality-first development enforcement
- Verification-before-completion patterns

**Commands & Modes Influenced:**
Many of our slash commands and behavioral modes are heavily influenced by Superpowers' workflow patterns and execution discipline.

These skills and logic patterns have been adapted and modified to fit the claude-ctx framework while maintaining the original MIT License. See `skills/LICENSE.superpowers` for full license text and proper attribution.

### SuperClaude Framework
**Repository:** [SuperClaude-Org/SuperClaude_Framework](https://github.com/SuperClaude-Org/SuperClaude_Framework)
**License:** MIT License
**Attribution:** Multiple agents, behavioral modes concepts, slash command patterns, and MCP integration architecture were directly copied and adapted from SuperClaude Framework.

**Agents Adapted (from 9 total agents):**
Several agents in the `agents/` directory are derived from SuperClaude, including specialized personas for:
- Development workflows (code-reviewer, debugger)
- Infrastructure management (cloud-architect, deployment-engineer, kubernetes-architect, terraform-specialist)
- Language specialists (python-pro, typescript-pro)
- Security (security-auditor)

**Architectural Patterns Adapted:**
- Behavioral modes system for context-aware workflows (`modes/` directory)
- Slash command architecture (`commands/` directory structure)
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration patterns
- Multi-agent orchestration concepts
- Session memory and documentation-driven development patterns

SuperClaude's comprehensive framework for transforming Claude Code into a structured development platform fundamentally shaped our approach to modes, commands, agent orchestration, and MCP integration.

### VoltAgent Awesome Claude Code Subagents
**Repository:** [VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents](https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents)
**License:** MIT License
**Attribution:** Multiple specialized agents were directly copied and adapted from VoltAgent's awesome-claude-code-subagents collection.

**Agents Adapted (from 9 total agents):**
Several agents in the `agents/` directory are derived from VoltAgent's 100+ agent collection, including:
- Full-stack development specialists
- DevOps and infrastructure agents
- Language-specific experts
- Quality and security focused agents

**Organizational Patterns Adapted:**
- Hierarchical agent categorization (10 major categories)
- Domain-specific context windows and permissions
- Production-ready agent templates
- Agent metadata and dependency tracking

The concept of organizing 100+ specialized agents into coherent categories directly informed our agent management system, the TUI's agent activation interface, and our agent metadata schema.

## Inspirations & Architectural Patterns

The following projects inspired architectural decisions, design patterns, and workflow concepts in claude-ctx (no direct code copying):

### Code CLI
**Repository:** [just-every/code](https://github.com/just-every/code)
**License:** Apache-2.0 License
**Inspiration:**
- Multi-agent orchestration patterns
- Unified settings architecture for centralized configuration
- Reasoning control mechanisms (depth/effort levels)
- Developer ergonomics and CLI design philosophy
- Theme customization system

Code's emphasis on developer experience, local-first architecture, and reasoning controls informed our TUI design, settings management, and the thinking budget system.
