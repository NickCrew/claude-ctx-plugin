# Skill Composition Map
# Defines dependencies between skills - when a skill is loaded, its dependencies are loaded automatically
# Format: skill_name: [list of required skills]
#
# Rules:
# - Dependencies are transitive (A requires B, B requires C â†’ load all three)
# - Circular dependencies are not allowed and will be detected
# - Dependencies should represent true knowledge requirements, not just related topics
