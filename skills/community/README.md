# Community Contributed Skills

Welcome to the community skills directory! This is where developers can contribute specialized knowledge and patterns to the Claude Cortex ecosystem.

## What are Community Skills?

Community skills are specialized knowledge modules contributed by the developer community that extend Claude's capabilities in specific domains. Unlike the core skills maintained by the project team, community skills are:

- **Community-maintained**: Created and updated by community members
- **Peer-reviewed**: Reviewed by other community members before acceptance
- **Opt-in**: Users choose which community skills to enable
- **Experimental**: May be promoted to core skills based on usage and quality

## Quick Start: Contributing a Skill

1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch
2. **Copy the template**: `cp skills/community/.template/SKILL.md skills/community/your-skill-name/SKILL.md`
3. **Write your skill** following the template structure
4. **Test locally**: `claude-ctx skills validate your-skill-name`
5. **Add registry entry**: Update `skills/community/registry.yaml`
6. **Submit pull request** with your skill and registry entry

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines.

## Skill Quality Standards

All community skills must meet these minimum standards:

### Required Elements

- [ ] **Valid YAML frontmatter** with name, description, author, version
- [ ] **Clear activation triggers** in description
- [ ] **"When to Use This Skill" section** with 5-10 specific scenarios
- [ ] **Progressive disclosure structure** (essential → detailed → advanced)
- [ ] **Practical code examples** with annotations
- [ ] **Best practices summary**
- [ ] **Author contact information** for maintenance

### Content Quality

- [ ] **Accurate information**: All patterns and examples must be correct
- [ ] **Current best practices**: Reflects industry standards (not outdated approaches)
- [ ] **Clear writing**: Well-organized, grammatically correct, professional tone
- [ ] **Proper attribution**: Credits sources, references official documentation
- [ ] **No promotional content**: Objective, educational focus (no product marketing)

### Technical Standards

- [ ] **Token budget**: 500-8,000 tokens (split if larger)
- [ ] **Validated**: Passes `claude-ctx skills validate`
- [ ] **No emojis**: Unless explicitly part of domain (e.g., commit message conventions)
- [ ] **Consistent formatting**: Follows template structure
- [ ] **Working examples**: All code examples are syntactically correct

## Contribution Process

### 1. Skill Idea Validation

Before creating a skill, check:

- **Does it already exist?** Search existing core and community skills
- **Is it too broad?** Split large skills into focused modules
- **Is it too narrow?** Consider if it warrants a standalone skill
- **Is it evergreen?** Avoid framework-specific skills tied to single versions

### 2. Skill Development

Use the template structure:

```yaml
---
name: your-skill-name
description: Brief description. Use when [clear trigger condition].
author: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
version: 1.0.0
license: MIT
tags: [category1, category2, category3]
---
```

Follow the progressive disclosure pattern:
1. **Overview** (1-2 paragraphs)
2. **When to Use** (bulleted list)
3. **Core Patterns** (essential → detailed → advanced)
4. **Examples** (practical, annotated code)
5. **Best Practices Summary**
6. **Resources** (official docs, references)

### 3. Testing and Validation

```bash
# Validate skill structure
claude-ctx skills validate your-skill-name

# Test skill loading
claude-ctx skills info your-skill-name

# Check token count
claude-ctx skills info your-skill-name --show-tokens
```

### 4. Registry Entry

Add your skill to `registry.yaml`:

```yaml
your-skill-name:
  author: Your Name
  email: your.email@example.com
  github: yourusername
  version: 1.0.0
  status: active
  created: 2024-10-17
  updated: 2024-10-17
  downloads: 0
  tags:
    - category1
    - category2
  related_skills:
    - related-skill-1
    - related-skill-2
```

## FAQ

### Q: Can I contribute a skill for a specific framework version?

A: Yes, but ensure the skill name reflects versioning (e.g., `vue3-composition-patterns` not `vue-patterns`). Consider if framework-agnostic patterns would be more valuable.

### Q: What if my skill overlaps with an existing skill?

A: Evaluate if yours provides unique value. Consider contributing improvements to existing skill instead of creating duplicate.

### Q: Can I contribute multiple related skills?

A: Yes! Consider skill composition - one skill can reference others. See `skills/composition.yaml` for examples.

### Q: How do I update my skill after it's merged?

A: Submit a new PR with changes, increment version number, and update the `updated` field in registry.

### Q: Can I transfer my skill to another maintainer?

A: Yes. Submit PR updating author information in both skill frontmatter and registry. Both parties should comment approving transfer.

### Q: What license should I use?

A: We recommend MIT license for maximum compatibility. You can choose any OSI-approved license.

### Q: Can organizations contribute skills?

A: Yes! Use organization name as author and provide designated contact person.
