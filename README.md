# Claude CTX Plugin

This repository packages the `claude-ctx` context management toolkit as a Claude Code plugin. It bundles the curated agents, commands, modes, rules, and supporting Python CLI so teams can install the complete experience through the plugin system or keep using the standalone `claude-ctx` script.

> ðŸ“š **Docs:** <https://nickcrew.github.io/claude-ctx-plugin/>

## Whatâ€™s inside

- `commands/` â€“ slash command definitions that surface curated behavioural prompts
- `agents/` and `agents-disabled/` â€“ Claude subagents with dependency metadata
- `modes/` and `modes-inactive/` â€“ opinionated context modules that toggle workflow defaults
- `rules/` â€“ reusable rule sets referenced by the CLI and plugin commands
- `profiles/`, `scenarios/`, `workflows/` â€“ higher-level orchestration templates for complex workstreams
- `claude_ctx_py/` and `claude-ctx-py` â€“ Python CLI entrypoint mirroring the original `claude-ctx`
- `schema/` and `scripts/` â€“ validation schemas and helper scripts

The plugin manifest lives in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` so Claude Code detects commands and agents automatically when the marketplace entry points to this repository.

## Installing via Claude Code

1. Add the marketplace that references this repository (see the companion [`NickCrew/claude-marketplace`](https://github.com/NickCrew/claude-marketplace) project).
2. Install the plugin with `/plugin install claude-ctx@<marketplace-name>`.
3. Restart Claude Code so the new commands and agents load.

After installation, the `/plugin` browser will list the bundled commands, and the `/agents` panel will show all active agents from the `agents/` directory.

## Installing the CLI

### Quick Install (Recommended)

Install the package, shell completions, and manpage with one command:

```bash
./scripts/install.sh
```

This will:
- Install `claude-ctx-py` in editable mode with dev dependencies
- Set up shell completions for your shell (bash/zsh/fish)
- Install the manpage system-wide

**Options:**
```bash
./scripts/install.sh --help              # Show all options
./scripts/install.sh --no-completions    # Skip completions
./scripts/install.sh --system-install    # Install system-wide (not editable)
./scripts/install.sh --shell zsh         # Specify shell for completions
```

### Using Make

```bash
make install        # Full installation
make install-dev    # Development installation
make help           # Show all targets
```

### Manual Installation

```bash
python3 -m pip install .
claude-ctx mode list
claude-ctx agent graph --export dependency-map.md
```

Running the CLI directly will operate on the directories in this repository, which mirror the layout expected inside `~/.claude`.

> **Tip:** The CLI looks in this order for its data folder: `CLAUDE_CTX_HOME`, `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` (set automatically when Claude Code runs plugin commands), then `~/.claude`. After installing the plugin you can point the standalone CLI at the cached copy with:
>
> ```bash
> export CLAUDE_CTX_HOME="$HOME/.claude/plugins/cache/claude-ctx"
> ```
>
> or, if you work from another checkout:
>
> ```bash
> export CLAUDE_CTX_HOME="$HOME/Developer/personal/claude-ctx-plugin"
> ```
>
> Set that once (for example in `~/.zshrc`) and both the CLI and Claude Code will use the same data without reinstalling.

### Shell completion

Shell completions are automatically installed when using `./scripts/install.sh`. For manual setup:

**Bash:**
```bash
register-python-argcomplete claude-ctx > ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/claude-ctx
source ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/claude-ctx
```

**Zsh:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/zsh/site-functions
register-python-argcomplete --shell zsh claude-ctx > ~/.local/share/zsh/site-functions/_claude-ctx
# Add to ~/.zshrc:
# fpath=(~/.local/share/zsh/site-functions $fpath)
# autoload -Uz compinit && compinit
```

**Fish:**
```bash
register-python-argcomplete --shell fish claude-ctx > ~/.config/fish/completions/claude-ctx.fish
```

### Manual page (manpage)

A comprehensive manual page is available in `docs/claude-ctx.1` and is automatically installed when using `./scripts/install.sh`.

**View locally:**
```bash
man docs/claude-ctx.1
```

**Manual installation:**
```bash
./scripts/install-manpage.sh
```

**After installation:**
```bash
man claude-ctx
```

The manpage documents all commands, subcommands, options, file locations, environment variables, and includes practical examples. It follows standard Unix manual page conventions and can be searched with `/` when viewing.

## Development notes

- Update the version in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` whenever you publish a new release.
- Keep semantic changes to commands or agents alongside changelog entries in `CLAUDE.md` or `RULES.md`.
- Use `claude plugin validate .` to confirm the manifest structure prior to publishing.

For marketplace configuration examples, see `../claude-private-marketplace`.

## Preview the docs locally

The documentation site under `docs/` now uses the default GitHub Pages **minima** theme with custom styling. To run it locally:

```bash
cd docs
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve --source . --livereload
```

Then open <http://127.0.0.1:4000>. Changes to Markdown or assets refresh automatically.
