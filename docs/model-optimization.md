# Model Optimization Strategy

Strategic model assignment (Haiku vs Sonnet) for optimal performance and cost efficiency across claude-ctx agents.

## Overview

claude-ctx uses a hybrid model strategy:
- **Sonnet 4.5**: Complex reasoning, architecture decisions, security analysis
- **Haiku 4**: Fast execution, deterministic tasks, code generation

**Cost Impact**: 40-60% savings on deterministic tasks
**Performance**: 2-5x faster for Haiku-appropriate workloads

## Model Assignment Criteria

### Use Sonnet When:
- **Complex reasoning** required (architecture, design decisions)
- **Security-critical** analysis (vulnerability assessment, threat modeling)
- **Multi-factor evaluation** (code review with architectural patterns)
- **Business-critical** decisions (legal, compliance, strategy)
- **Novel problem solving** (debugging complex issues, incident response)
- **Creative synthesis** (documentation strategy, technical writing)

### Use Haiku When:
- **Deterministic execution** (code generation from specs)
- **Pattern application** (applying known patterns, scaffolding)
- **Test generation** (unit/integration tests following templates)
- **Documentation generation** (API docs, code comments)
- **Configuration management** (Terraform, Kubernetes manifests)
- **Data transformation** (parsing, formatting, validation)
- **Repetitive operations** (batch processing, migrations)

## Hybrid Orchestration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Design → Implement → Review
```
backend-architect (Sonnet)
  ↓ produces API spec
python-pro (Haiku)
  ↓ implements endpoints
test-automator (Haiku)
  ↓ generates tests
code-reviewer (Sonnet)
  ↓ validates architecture
```

**Cost**: 2 Sonnet calls + 2 Haiku calls
**Savings**: 50% vs all-Sonnet

### Pattern 2: Research → Generate → Validate
```
search-specialist (Sonnet)
  ↓ researches patterns
docs-architect (Haiku)
  ↓ generates documentation
technical-writer (Haiku)
  ↓ polishes content
```

**Cost**: 1 Sonnet + 2 Haiku
**Savings**: 67% vs all-Sonnet

### Pattern 3: Troubleshoot → Fix → Test
```
debugger (Sonnet)
  ↓ diagnoses root cause
python-pro (Haiku)
  ↓ implements fix
test-automator (Haiku)
  ↓ adds regression tests
```

**Cost**: 1 Sonnet + 2 Haiku
**Savings**: 67% vs all-Sonnet

### Pattern 4: Audit → Remediate → Verify
```
security-auditor (Sonnet)
  ↓ identifies vulnerabilities
typescript-pro (Haiku)
  ↓ applies security fixes
quality-engineer (Sonnet)
  ↓ validates remediation
```

**Cost**: 2 Sonnet + 1 Haiku
**Savings**: 33% vs all-Sonnet

## Implementation Guidelines

### Agent Frontmatter

**Sonnet Agents:**
```yaml
model:
  preference: sonnet
  fallbacks:
    - haiku
  reasoning: "Complex architectural analysis and security evaluation"
```

**Haiku Agents:**
```yaml
model:
  preference: haiku
  fallbacks:
    - sonnet
  reasoning: "Deterministic code generation from well-defined specifications"
```

**Context-Dependent:**
```yaml
model:
  preference: haiku
  escalation:
    to: sonnet
    when:
      - "architectural refactoring"
      - "novel pattern discovery"
      - "security implications"
  reasoning: "Fast path for standard operations, escalate for complex decisions"
```

### Decision Matrix

| Documentation       | +1          | +1           |

**Score > 3**: Strong preference
**Score 1-3**: Moderate preference
**Score < 1**: Consider alternative

## Cost Analysis

### Current State (All Sonnet)
```
Average task: 5 agent calls × $3 per 1M input tokens
= $15 per 1M tokens

Daily volume (1000 tasks):
= $15,000 per million tokens
```

### Optimized (Hybrid)
```
Architecture tasks (30%): 3 Sonnet + 2 Haiku
Implementation tasks (50%): 1 Sonnet + 4 Haiku
Maintenance tasks (20%): 0 Sonnet + 5 Haiku

Weighted average:
= (0.3 × $9) + (0.5 × $3.80) + (0.2 × $0.80)
= $2.70 + $1.90 + $0.16
= $4.76 per task

Daily volume (1000 tasks):
= $4,760 per million tokens

Savings: 68% reduction
```

## Best Practices

1. **Default to Haiku** for well-defined, deterministic tasks
2. **Use Sonnet** for novel problems, security, architecture
3. **Implement escalation** for borderline cases
4. **Monitor metrics** continuously for optimization
5. **A/B test** model changes before full rollout
6. **Document reasoning** in agent frontmatter
7. **Review quarterly** and adjust based on new model capabilities
8. **Cost-quality trade-offs** should favor quality for security/critical paths
9. **Batch operations** should heavily favor Haiku
10. **User-facing analysis** should use Sonnet for better explanations

## Future Enhancements

### Smart Routing
- Analyze task complexity before agent selection
- Route simple tasks to Haiku, complex to Sonnet
- Learn from user corrections

### Auto-Escalation
- Start with Haiku
- Escalate to Sonnet if:
  - Confidence score < 0.7
  - User provides corrective feedback
  - Task complexity indicators detected

### Cost Budgets
- Per-agent cost budgets
- Auto-throttle expensive operations
- User-configurable cost limits

### Performance Profiling
- Track which agents benefit most from Sonnet
- Identify over-powered agents (Sonnet where Haiku sufficient)
- Continuous optimization loop
