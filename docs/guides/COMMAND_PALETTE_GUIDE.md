# Command Palette Guide 🎨

## Overview

The TUI now has a **beautiful, functional command palette** with visual styling and 11 custom commands for quick navigation and actions!

## How to Use

### Open Command Palette

Press **Ctrl+P** in the TUI to open the command palette.

> **New:** The palette now launches on its own worker, so it stays responsive even if other dialogs (task details, log viewers, etc.) are open. If Ctrl+P used to throw a `NoActiveWorker` error in older builds, that workflow is now fixed.

- **"agent"** → Shows agent management commands

## Technical Details

### Implementation Files
- `claude_ctx_py/tui_commands.py` → Command provider with visual styling
- `claude_ctx_py/tui_textual.py` → TUI with `COMMANDS` registration

### Key Learning
Textual uses `COMMANDS` (set), not `COMMAND_PROVIDERS` (list)!

```python
# Correct
COMMANDS = {AgentCommandProvider}

# Wrong
COMMAND_PROVIDERS = [AgentCommandProvider]
```

## Tips

1. **Quick navigation**: Press Ctrl+P and type first letters of what you want
2. **Learn shortcuts**: Command descriptions show keyboard shortcuts
3. **Visual cues**: Icon colors indicate action type (view, activate, toggle, etc.)
4. **Context help**: Descriptions explain what happens after selecting
5. **Safe reopening**: Because the palette runs in a dedicated worker, you can pop it open repeatedly—even while workflows are launching or logs are streaming—without destabilising the TUI.

## Example Workflows

### Activate an Agent
1. Press **Ctrl+P**
2. Type **"activate"**
3. Press **Enter**
4. In agents view, use arrows to select agent
5. Press **Space** to activate

### Toggle a Mode
1. Press **Ctrl+P**
2. Type **"toggle mode"**
3. Press **Enter**
4. In modes view, select mode
5. Press **Space** to toggle

### Export Context
1. Press **Ctrl+P**
2. Type **"export"**
3. Press **Enter**
4. Configure export options

Enjoy your enhanced TUI experience! 🎉
