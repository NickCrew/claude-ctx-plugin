```

---

### üöÄ /deploy - Deployment Commands
Release preparation and deployment automation.

**Available Commands:**
- `prepare-release` - Prepare application for production deployment

**Usage:**
```bash

## Using Commands

### Via Claude Code Chat
Simply type the command in the chat:
```
/dev:code-review src/components
```

### Via CLI (Future)
```bash
claude-ctx cmd dev:code-review src/components
claude-ctx cmd test:generate-tests --coverage-target 90
```

## Command Structure

Each command file includes:

```yaml
---
name: command-name
description: What the command does
category: namespace
agents: [agent1, agent2]
---

## Creating Custom Commands

1. Choose the appropriate namespace:
   - `/dev` - Development and code tasks
   - `/test` - Testing operations
   - `/deploy` - Deployment and release
   - `/analyze` - Analysis and auditing

2. Create a markdown file:
   ```bash
   touch ~/.claude/commands/[namespace]/[command-name].md
   ```

3. Follow the template structure:
   - YAML frontmatter with metadata
   - Purpose and triggers
   - Usage instructions
   - Detailed process steps
   - Output format
   - Examples

## Agent Integration

Commands can invoke specialized agents:

**Development Agents:**
- `code-reviewer` - Code quality analysis
- `refactoring-expert` - Code refactoring
- `typescript-pro` / `python-pro` - Language specialists

**Testing Agents:**
- `test-automator` - Test generation
- `quality-engineer` - Quality assurance

**Deployment Agents:**
- `deployment-engineer` - Release preparation
- `devops-architect` - Infrastructure

**Analysis Agents:**
- `security-auditor` - Security assessment
- `performance-engineer` - Performance analysis

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Naming** - Use descriptive, action-oriented names
2. **Focused Purpose** - Each command does one thing well
3. **Consistent Structure** - Follow the template format
4. **Agent Composition** - Leverage multiple agents when needed
5. **Documentation** - Provide clear usage examples

## Future Namespaces

Planned additions:
- `/docs` - Documentation generation
- `/optimize` - Performance optimization
- `/refactor` - Code refactoring
- `/monitor` - Application monitoring
