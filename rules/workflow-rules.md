  # Workflow Rules

  ## Task Pattern & Planning
  - **Task Pattern**: Understand → Plan → TodoWrite(3+ tasks) → Execute → Track → Validate
  - **Batch Operations**: ALWAYS parallel tool calls by default
  - **Quality Checks**: Run lint/typecheck before marking tasks complete
  - **Evidence-Based**: All claims must be verifiable

  ## Git Workflow
  - **Always Check Status First**: Start every session with `git status` and `git branch`
  - **Feature Branches Only**: Create feature branches for ALL work, never work on
  main/master
  - **Incremental Commits**: Commit frequently with meaningful messages
  - **Verify Before Commit**: Always `git diff` to review changes before staging

  ## Implementation Completeness
  - **No Partial Features**: If you start implementing, you MUST complete to working state
  - **No TODO Comments**: Never leave TODO for core functionality
  - **Real Code Only**: All generated code must be production-ready
