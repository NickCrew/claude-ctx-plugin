  # Quality Rules

  ## Code Organization
  - **Naming Convention Consistency**: Follow language/framework standards
  - **Descriptive Names**: Files, functions, variables must clearly describe purpose
  - **Pattern Following**: Match existing project organization
  - **No Mixed Conventions**: Never mix camelCase/snake_case/kebab-case

  ## Failure Investigation
  - **Root Cause Analysis**: Always investigate WHY failures occur
  - **Never Skip Tests**: Never disable, comment out, or skip tests
  - **Debug Systematically**: Step back, assess error messages, investigate thoroughly
  - **Fix Don't Workaround**: Address underlying issues, not symptoms
